# Distributed Systems (SD)

#### Project Description:

* The general idea behind this project is to create a client/server based application to manage content stored in the system and deal with operations like download, upload, search, register user and authenticate.
* The Client and Server apps communicate with  each other using TCP Sockets in Java. With those we transfer files from 1 end user to another and manage concurrent access to the database.

> Note: All the major project settings can be changed in the config.cnf file, such as the user/server files folder.
